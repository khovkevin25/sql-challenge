# sql-challenge

## Kevin Khov

In this challenge, we used SQL to replicate tasks that a data engineer would perform in data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, using the given CSV files. With data modeling, we were tasked to look through the CSV files to map out a diagram of the different relationships between each file. Wirh data engineering, we used SQL to create tables to house the data from the CSV files for analysis. With data analysis, we were used SQL to find outputs based on the given prompts.

All data from the CSV files (a total of six) are housed in the "data" folder. The image of the data modeling part of the challenge is in the file "sql-challenge-data-modeling.png". The code used in the data engineering part of the challenge is in the file "sql-challenge-data-engineering.sql". The code used in the data analysis part of the challenge is in the file "sql-challenge-data-analysis.sql".
